# MP3Calc

A simple app to determine two angle that define the tilt of a rigid planar sample. 

To use it, you must know the length and width of your desired sample. 

Then measure the sample z position at three corners (as you already know the x,y positions).

The tilt in two orthogonal axes will then be created.
